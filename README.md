# UberLand Rideshare

## **What is UberLand Rideshare?**
Uberland Rideshare is a community-run ride hailing site that allows users to arrive to their destination using other user's cars to hitch a ride!

## **How dies UberLand Rideshare run?**
Making use of Python for data handling and hosting, HTML to design the site pages and CSS to beautify them, we have created a solution to improving transportation efficiency by allowing citizens to hitch a ride with other citizens, solving the need for dedicated taxi drivers.

## **Some problems we faced**
1. **Time constraint** - We were given a limited time to code out the website. However, we overcomed this challenge by reducing the functions of the website that we felt were redundant
2. **Communication** - Communication was not always there as each of us were busy with out day-to-day tasks. However, we overcomed this challenge by dedicating tasks among each other so that everyone could contribute even without the presence of other teammates

## **Improvements we can make to UberLand Rideshare**
1. **User Experience** - Adding more interaction between the user and the site like haptic response
2. **Website Functionality** - Adding more features like a map or real-time updates when driver accepts the ride

## **Steps on running the site**
1. Download the code
2. Download the modules in requirements.txt (Important as we used different versions of the modules from the latest release)
3. At the bottom of main.py, configure the ip address and the port that the website will be running on
4. Run main.py

# UberLand Rideshare

## What is UberLand Rideshare?
UberLand Rideshare is a community-driven ride-hailing platform that allows users to share rides, reaching their destinations in other users' cars!

## How Does UberLand Rideshare Run?
We've leveraged Python for data handling and hosting, HTML for website design, and CSS for an appealing user interface. This solution enhances transportation efficiency by enabling citizens to hitch rides with fellow citizens, eliminating the need for dedicated taxi drivers.

## Challenges We Faced
1. **Time Constraint**:
   - Given limited time, we streamlined the website by removing redundant functions.

2. **Communication**:
   - Communication was occasionally challenging due to busy schedules. However, we overcame this by dividing tasks among team members, allowing contributions even when teammates were unavailable.

## Future Enhancements for UberLand Rideshare
1. **User Experience**:
   - Enhance user interaction with features like haptic response.

2. **Website Functionality**:
   - Add features such as mapping and real-time ride updates when drivers accept requests.

## Steps to Run the Site
1. Download the code.
2. Install the required modules listed in `requirements.txt` (ensure you use the specified versions).
3. In `main.py`, configure the IP address and port for the website.
4. Run `main.py`.
